# Device Tracker

Will track DHCP requests from your selected devices and report it to Home Assistant.<br>
Should be much faster than the Home Assistant phone app.<br>

## Configuration
This addon will currently send an API request to notify of a new device in the network.<br>
This is meant to be used with **Node-RED** which is why the configuration will ask your<br>
Node-RED username and password.
